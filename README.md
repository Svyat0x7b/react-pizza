# 🍕REACT-PIZZA

This project is a frontend app of a pizza shop. There are a lot of functionality cause i have used big amount of technologies that now are top-notched in the frontend development.

## ⚜️Technologies

- ReactJS
- TypeScript
- Redux Toolkit
- React Router V6
- Axios & Fetch
- SCSS
- React Content Loader (for skeletons)
- React Paginate (for pagination)
- Lodash.debounce (for setting timeout to send search request to mock backend)
- Code Splitting (chunks)
- Lazy Loading

## To install the project dependecies execute: ✔️

`npm install`

## To run the project execute: ✔️

`npm start`

## What about backend? 🔸

As a backend I`ve used the MockAPI service(https://mockapi.io/). This is a service which provide an simple API for your custom data. Also it provides a sorting and searching on the backend side.

## Responsive and Ergonomic Layout

React Pizza is fully responsive for mobile tablet and desktop devices. There are simple and bright UI. Many options to choose or just enjoy clicking on the buttons(: 

## Pages 🔸

The web app contain 4 routes that render different pages:
- Home `/`
- Cart `/cart`
- PizzaItem `/pizzas/:id`
- NotFound `for any another route`

## Plans for future developing and advancing the project 🔸

At that point I have several ides:
- implement authorization(JWT)
- real-time chat to support customers(Websocket.io)
- add the ability to write comments to the pizzas
- implement the promocodes for inviting friends
